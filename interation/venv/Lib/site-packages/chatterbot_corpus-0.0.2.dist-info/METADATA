Description: ChatterBot Language Training Corpus
        ===================================
        
        |Package Version| |Build Status|
        
        These modules are used to quickly train ChatterBot to respond to various
        inputs in different languages. Although much of ChatterBot is designed
        to be language independent, it is still useful to have these training
        sets available to prime a fresh database and make the variety of
        responses that a bot can yield much more diverse.
        
        For instructions on how to use these data sets, please refer to the
        `project
        documentation <http://chatterbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/training.html#training-with-corpus-data>`__.
        
        All training data contained within this corpus is user contributed.
        
        If you are interested in contributing support for a new language please
        create a pull request. Additions are welcomed!

        ============
        
        “A true professional does not waste the time and money of other people
        by handing over software that is not reasonably free of obvious bugs;
        that has not undergone minimal unit testing; that does not meet the
        specifications and requirements; that is gold-plated with unnecessary
        features; or that looks like junk.” – Daniel Read
